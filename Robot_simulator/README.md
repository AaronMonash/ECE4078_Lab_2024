# Simulator Environment

We provide a simulator environment using [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) as an addition to the physical robot.

**Please note that markings are done on the physical robot.**

  - Please refer to the [Installation Guide for simulator](InstallationGuideSim.md) for detailed instructions on setting up and testing the simulator environment.
  - You can run scripts such as [operate.py](../Week00-01/operate.py) by typing ```python3 operate.py``` in a terminal inside your Ubuntu environment (VM/native/WSL2, whichever one you use). **You will need to launch the simulator environment first.** This command will open a GUI with the simulated robot's camera view shown.
  - For using the physical robot, please refer to the [Installation Guide for physical robot](../Week00-01/InstallationGuidePhysical.md)
