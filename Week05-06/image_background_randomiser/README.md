# Image Background Randomiser

The [image_generator.py](image_generator.py) script generates randomly transform input images and place them 
on random background images. 

## Usage
1. Remove the background of the input images with this [background removing tool](https://www.remove.bg/) or other software
of your choice. The images should be like this one: ![potato](fruit_images/potato2.png)
2. Place the input images in the [fruit_images](fruit_images) folder
3. Place the background images in the [background_images](background_images) folder
4. Run the script with `python image_generator.py`
5. The generated images will be placed in the [generated_images](generated_images) folder

Note that *foo* in the [generated_images](generated_images) folder is only a placeholder for the folder to be uploaded to
Github.
